# YT Subtitle on PIP

This web extension allows you to watch YouTube videos with subtitles in a Picture-in-Picture (PIP) window.

And before you ask, yes, I made this in just a day since I didn't have much time to work on it.
I probably don't have time to maintain it either, so feel free to make a PR if you want to improve it.

## Known issues

- Sometimes the `<track>` element gets duplicated a bunch of times
  - Closing and reopening the PIP window should fix this..or toggle the subtitles off and on again
